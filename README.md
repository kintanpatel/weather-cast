###  API Key Setup

This app uses [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather data.

You must add your API key to the `local.properties` file in the root of the project:

```properties
OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY = <Your API Key>
```

> Replace the value above with your own key if needed. This key is accessed safely through Gradle at runtime.
